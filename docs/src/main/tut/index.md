# Corbeans

Corbeans provides integration and other utilities for developers working with  
[Spring-Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).

The project is usable but far from any notion of being 'complete'. Please browse
the [current issues](https://github.com/manosbatsis/corda-spring/issues) to get an idea of
the work in progress and post any questions or suggestions you may have.
